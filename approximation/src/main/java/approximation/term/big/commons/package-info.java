/**
 * Provides concrete implementations of commonly used series terms for high-precision calculations.
 * <p>
 * This package includes ready-to-use classes for mathematical series expansions, such as:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Exponential series ({@link approximation.term.big.commons.ExponentialTerm})</li>
 *   <li>Logarithmic series ({@link approximation.term.big.commons.GregoryLogarithmTerm})</li>
 *   <li>Euler number series ({@link approximation.term.big.commons.EulerNumberTerm})</li>
 * </ul>
 * These implementations extend the abstractions defined in the {@code big} package.
