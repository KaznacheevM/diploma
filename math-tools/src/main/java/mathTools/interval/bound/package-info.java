/**
 * Provides classes and interfaces for defining and managing interval bounds.
 *
 * <p>This package contains the {@link mathTools.interval.bound.Bound} interface,
 * which defines the behavior of bounds (both finite and infinite), as well as concrete
 * implementations such as {@link mathTools.interval.bound.finite.FiniteBound}
 * and {@link mathTools.interval.bound.infinite.DirectionalInfiniteBound}.
 *
 * <p>Key classes and interfaces:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link mathTools.interval.bound.Bound} â€” the primary interface for defining bounds.</li>
 *     <li>Subpackages {@code finite} and {@code infinite} contain specific implementations for
 *     finite and infinite bounds, respectively.</li>
 * </ul>
